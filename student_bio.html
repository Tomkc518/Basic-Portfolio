    <p>
            I was born on a warm Christmas day in San Diego 84'. My father was in the Navy and so I moved a lot as a child. First to Virgina, then Georgia, back to his home state of Michigan and ultimately my current home of Kansas City, MO where I live with my boyfriend Chad and our dog Hank.

            My hobbies include table top board and card games, notabley Magic the Gathering. I also find myself filling my free time playing video games, going to the dog park, and seeing the latest comic book movie. You will often see me in the kitchen making pasta and multi-tiered delicious cakes.
